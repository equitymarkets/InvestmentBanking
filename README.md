## Group Project #1

### Project Title: Analysis of Top Investment Banks

### Team Members of Group 3: Derek P, Katie B, Cheryl Z, Kevin N, Ray H 

#### Project Description/Outline: 

Our project aims to perform a data analysis of the top investment banks using various datasets and visualize the findings using Matplotlib. This project will be divided into multiple tasks, with each member focusing on a specific aspect of the project research. 

#### Questions to Answer:

1.	What is the market share of each of the top investment banks in terms of revenue and assets?
2.	How has the revenue and profitability of the top investment banks evolved over the past five years?
3.	What are the key drivers of revenue and profitability for investment banks?

#### Dataset to be Used:

The team will use publicly available financial data for the top investment banks, such as annual reports, financial statements, and other relevant sources. The team will also use APIs to gather additional data, such as stock prices, news articles, and analyst ratings. 

#### Rough Breakdown of Tasks:

•	*Data Collection and Cleaning:* will be responsible for collecting and cleaning the data using Pandas. We will create a Jupyter Notebook to document the data exploration and cleanup process.

•	*Data Analysis:* will use Pandas to perform the data analysis and create visualizations using Matplotlib. We will create a Jupyter Notebook to illustrate the final data analysis.

•	*Visualization:* will create 6 to 8 visualizations of the data, at least 2 visualizations per research question, using Matplotlib. We will save PNG images of the visualizations to share with the class and instructional team.

•	*Write-up:* will contribute to writing a summary of the major findings, including headings, for each research question, as well as a short description of the findings and relevant plots.

•	*Bonus Task:* will use at least one API to gather additional data pertinent to the research questions.
